Jaspos To Do
============
1) Get bootloader code onto github
2) More comments in more code
3) Clean-up functions which still use my old convention of passing arguments in AX. These must be converted to accepting arguments from the stack.
4) Get Disk I/O working (at least floppy disk)
5) Continue work on the shell application
